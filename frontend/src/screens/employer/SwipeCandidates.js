/**
 * Why this screen exists:
 * Finding candidates should be quick and fun. This screen helps:
 * 1. Review candidates efficiently:
 *    - Swipe right to show interest
 *    - Swipe left to pass
 *    - View detailed profiles
 *    - Save candidates for later
 * 
 * 2. Make better hiring decisions:
 *    - See key qualifications at a glance
 *    - Compare with job requirements
 *    - Check experience match
 *    - View skill compatibility
 * 
 * Think of it as speed dating for hiring that:
 * - Makes candidate review engaging
 * - Speeds up initial screening
 * - Focuses on what matters most
 * - Creates better matches
 * 
 * Without this screen:
 * - Reviewing candidates would be tedious
 * - Good matches might be missed
 * - Initial screening would take longer
 * - The hiring process would be less engaging
 * 
 * @fileoverview Provides a swipe interface for reviewing potential candidates
