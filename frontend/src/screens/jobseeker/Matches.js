/**
 * @fileoverview Job Seeker Matches Screen
 * 
 * This screen displays all the successful matches between the job seeker and potential
 * employers. A match occurs when both the employer and job seeker have expressed interest
 * in each other (similar to dating apps), indicating a mutual fit for the position.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - List of matched employers/jobs
 * - Match status indicators (new, in progress, archived)
 * - Quick actions for each match (message, view details, archive)
 * - Sorting and filtering options
 * - Match statistics and insights
 * 
 * User Experience:
 * The screen presents matches in a card-based layout, prioritizing new matches at the top.
 * Each match card provides essential information about the job and employer, with clear
 * call-to-action buttons for next steps. The design emphasizes the mutual interest aspect
 * to encourage user engagement.
 * 
 * @example
 * // To navigate to the Matches screen
 * navigation.navigate('Matches');
